        Hello, my name is <a class="mdl-color-text--white" href="https://github.com/genemars" title="Generoso Martello's profile on GitHub">Gene</a>
        and I started to learn computers programming in early 80's when I was 12.
        Few years later, passionate not just for coding but also for tinkering, hacking and networking,
        I created a local BBS which was then connected to FidoNet.
        Some more later, Internet and programming became my work and since then I really never stopped
        creating software and growing up with technology.
        <br>
        Today I'm what they call a <span class="mdl-color-text--grey-400">Full-Stack Developer</span>
        with a passion for smart home, the open source world and collaborative development.
        Occasionally I also pretend to be learning guitar. I believe that if I keep pretending,
        it might accidentally happen at some point =)
