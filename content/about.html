        Hello, my name is <a class="mdl-color-text--white" href="https://github.com/genemars" title="Generoso Martello's profile on GitHub">Gene</a>
        and I learned computers programming in early 80's when I was 12.
        Later this became my work and since then I really never stopped creating software and growing up with technology.
        Even though I had to leave my "steady" job in 2013, I still keep dedicating myself to software development
        by creating open source products.
        This is where <strong>g-labs</strong>, <em>the open source factory</em>, came from.
