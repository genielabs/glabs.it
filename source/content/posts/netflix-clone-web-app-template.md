I've spent some time in the last two days developing a new web app template and I wanted to share it here.


<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6FhQNHlpco" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Source code and documentation are as usual available on GitHub:


https://github.com/zuixjs/zuix-web-flix


and here is the [LIVE DEMO](https://zuixjs.github.io/zuix-web-flix/).

So, I hope you like this template and if you have a suggestion for improving it or for what I should make next, please
feel free to leave a comment =)
