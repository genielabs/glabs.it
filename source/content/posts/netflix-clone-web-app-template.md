{% include 'fragments/zuixjs-deprecated-content-notice.html' %}

I've spent some time in the last two days developing a new web app template and I wanted to share it here.

Source code and documentation are as usual available on GitHub:


https://github.com/zuixjs/zuix-web-flix


and here is the [LIVE DEMO](https://zuixjs.github.io/zuix-web-flix/).

So, I hope you like this template and if you have a suggestion for improving it or for what I should make next, please
feel free to leave a comment =)
