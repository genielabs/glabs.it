        Hello, my name is <a class="mdl-color-text--white" href="https://github.com/genemars" title="Generoso Martello's profile on GitHub">Gene</a>
        and I started to learn computers programming in early 80's when I was 12.
        Few years later, moved by passion not just for coding but also for tinkering, hacking and networking,
        I created a local BBS which then became also a FidoNet node.
        After that the approach into the Internet era was kind of natural but still very exciting.
        <br>
        Internet and programming became my work and since then I really never stopped creating
        software and growing up with technology.
        <br>
        Today I'm what they call a <span class="mdl-color-text--grey-400">Full-Stack Developer</span>
        with a passion for smart home, the open source world and collaborative development.
        Occasionally I also pretend to be learning guitar. I believe that if I keep pretending,
        it may accidentally truly happen at some point =)
