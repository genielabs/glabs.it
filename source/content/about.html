        Hello, my name is <a class="mdl-color-text--white" href="https://github.com/genemars" title="Generoso Martello's profile on GitHub">Gene</a>
        and I started to learn computers programming in early 80's when I was 12.

        Then, a few birthdays later I bought my first analog modem and after a little
        hacking I started a BBS which then back in the 90's became a FidoNet node
        that later lead me into the Internet era and IRC (social thing the old way).
    </p>
    <p class="smaller">
        All of this, software development and networking, later became my work and since then
        I really never stopped creating software and growing up with technology.

        Today I'm what's called a <em class="mdl-color-text--grey-400">Full-Stack Developer</em>
        with a passion for smart home, micro-controllers, the open source world and collaborative working.
        Occasionally I pretend to be learning to play guitar. I believe that if I continue pretending,
        it may accidentally truly happen at some point =)
