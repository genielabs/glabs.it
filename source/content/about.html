        Hello, my name is <a class="mdl-color-text--white" href="https://github.com/genemars" title="Generoso Martello's profile on GitHub">Gene</a>
        and I started to learn computers programming in early 80's when I was 12.
        With a passion not just for coding but also for tinkering, hacking and networking,
        few years later, I was running a BBS which then became a FidoNet node.
        After that the approach into the Internet era was kind of natural but still very exciting.

        All of this, software development and networking, later became my work and since then
        I really never stopped creating software and growing up with technology.

        Today I'm what's called a <em class="mdl-color-text--grey-400">Full-Stack Developer</em>
        with a passion for smart home, micro-controllers, the open source world and collaborative working.
        Occasionally I pretend to be learning to play guitar. I believe that if I continue pretending,
        it may accidentally truly happen at some point =)
